step 1:prompt 1

Create a premium SaaS design system called "Placement Readiness Platform".

This is not a student project. This must feel like a serious B2C product company.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:

Calm, Intentional, Coherent, Confident
Not flashy, not loud, not playful, not hackathon-style
No gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon colors, no animation noise
COLOR SYSTEM:

Background: #F7F6F3 (off-white)
Primary text: #111111
Accent: #8B0000 (deep red)
Success: muted green
Warning: muted amber
Use maximum 4 colors across entire system
TYPOGRAPHY:

Headings: Serif font, large, confident, generous spacing
Body: Clean sans-serif, 16–18px, line-height 1.6–1.8, max 720px for text blocks
No decorative fonts, no random sizes
SPACING SYSTEM (consistent scale): 8px, 16px, 24px, 40px, 64px Never use random spacing like 13px, 27px, etc. Whitespace is part of design.

GLOBAL LAYOUT STRUCTURE: Every page must follow: [Top Bar] → [Context Header] → [Primary Workspace + Secondary Panel] → [Proof Footer]

TOP BAR:

Left: Project name
Center: Progress indicator (Step X / Y)
Right: Status badge (Not Started / In Progress / Shipped)
CONTEXT HEADER:

Large serif headline, 1-line subtext, clear purpose, no hype language
PRIMARY WORKSPACE (70% width):

Where the main product interaction happens
Clean cards, predictable components, no crowding
SECONDARY PANEL (30% width):

Step explanation (short)
Copyable prompt box
Buttons: Copy, Build in Lovable, It Worked, Error, Add Screenshot
Calm styling
PROOF FOOTER (persistent bottom section): Checklist style: □ UI Built □ Logic Working □ Test Passed □ Deployed Each checkbox requires user proof input.

COMPONENT RULES:

Primary button = solid deep red, Secondary = outlined
Same hover effect and border radius everywhere
Inputs: clean borders, no heavy shadows, clear focus state
Cards: subtle border, no drop shadows, balanced padding
INTERACTION RULES:

Transitions: 150–200ms, ease-in-out, no bounce, no parallax
ERROR & EMPTY STATES:

Errors: explain what went wrong + how to fix, never blame user
Empty states: provide next action, never feel dead
Everything must feel like one mind designed it. No visual drift. Return confirmation once design system is created. Do NOT add product features yet.





step 2:prompt 2

Create a Placement Readiness Platform application with React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router.

1. Build a landing page with:
   - A hero section: heading "Ace Your Placement", subheading "Practice, assess, and prepare for your dream job", and a "Get Started" button
   - A features grid (3 columns) with cards: "Practice Problems" (with code icon), "Mock Interviews" (with video icon), "Track Progress" (with chart icon). Each card has a title and one-line description.
   - A footer with copyright text

2. Create an app shell for the dashboard area with:
   - Sidebar navigation with links: Dashboard, Practice, Assessments, Resources, Profile
   - Use lucide-react icons for each nav item
   - A header showing "Placement Readiness Platform" and a user avatar placeholder
   - Main content area with <Outlet />

3. Use an indigo/purple color scheme — primary: hsl(245, 58%, 51%).

4. Make the "Get Started" button navigate to the Dashboard page. Create placeholder pages for each route.



step 3:prompt 3

Build the Dashboard page with the following components:

1. "Overall Readiness" — a large circular progress indicator showing 72/100. Use a custom SVG circle with stroke-dasharray animation. Show the number in the center with "Readiness Score" label below.

2. "Skill Breakdown" — a radar chart using recharts with 5 axes: DSA (75), System Design (60), Communication (80), Resume (85), Aptitude (70). Use ResponsiveContainer.

3. "Continue Practice" — a card showing the last topic: "Dynamic Programming", with a progress bar (3/10 completed) and a "Continue" button.

4. "Weekly Goals" — show "Problems Solved: 12/20 this week" with a progress bar. Below it, show 7 small day circles (Mon-Sun), filled for days with activity.

5. "Upcoming Assessments" — a list of 3 items:
   - "DSA Mock Test" — Tomorrow, 10:00 AM
   - "System Design Review" — Wed, 2:00 PM
   - "HR Interview Prep" — Friday, 11:00 AM

Use shadcn/ui Card components. Layout: 2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile. Use recharts for the radar chart with mock data.


step 4:prompt 4

Upgrade Placement Readiness Platform with REAL working analysis logic (still no external scraping).

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Keep premium design.
- Persist history in localStorage.

1) Implement skill extraction (heuristic):

Detect keywords from JD text (case-insensitive) across categories:

Core CS:
DSA, OOP, DBMS, OS, Networks

Languages:
Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, C#, Go

Web:
React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, REST, GraphQL

Data:
SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis

Cloud/DevOps:
AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Linux

Testing:
Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, JUnit, PyTest

If JD includes none, still show "General fresher stack".

2) Generate outputs from detected skills:

A) Key skills extracted
- show tags grouped by category

B) Round-wise preparation checklist (template-based):
- Round 1: Aptitude / Basics
- Round 2: DSA + Core CS
- Round 3: Tech interview (projects + stack)
- Round 4: Managerial / HR

Each round should list 5–8 checklist items based on skills detected.

C) 7-day plan:
Day 1–2: Basics + core CS
Day 3–4: DSA + coding practice
Day 5: Project + resume alignment
Day 6: Mock interview questions
Day 7: Revision + weak areas

Adapt the plan based on detected skills (e.g., React present → include frontend revision).

D) 10 likely interview questions:
Generate questions based on detected skills.
Example:
If SQL present → "Explain indexing and when it helps."
If React present → "Explain state management options."
If DSA present → "How would you optimize search in sorted data?"
Keep questions specific, not generic.

3) Readiness score (0–100):
Start 35.
+5 per detected category present (max 30).
+10 if company name provided.
+10 if role provided.
+10 if JD length > 800 chars.
Cap at 100.

4) Save to History:
On Analyze, store an entry in localStorage:
{
  id,
  createdAt,
  company,
  role,
  jdText,
  extractedSkills,
  plan,
  checklist,
  questions,
  readinessScore
}

History page:
- list entries with date + company + role + score
- clicking one opens /results with that saved entry

Results page must render latest analysis or selected history item.

No external APIs.
No scraping.
Everything must work offline and persist on refresh.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm skill extraction works
- Confirm history persists after refresh
- Provide steps to verify with a sample JD





step 5:prompt 5

Upgrade Placement Readiness Platform by making results interactive and exportable.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Keep premium design.
- Persist changes per history entry.

1) Interactive skill self-assessment

On /results in "Key skills extracted":
- Each skill tag must have a toggle:
  - "I know this"
  - "Need practice"
Default: Need practice

Store user selection inside the history entry under:
skillConfidenceMap[skill] = "know" | "practice"

2) Live readiness score updates

Start from base readinessScore (already computed).
Then:
+2 for each skill marked "I know"
-2 for each skill marked "Need practice"
Bounds: 0–100
Update score in real-time.

3) Export tools

Add buttons on /results:
- "Copy 7-day plan" (plain text)
- "Copy round checklist"
- "Copy 10 questions"
- "Download as TXT" (single file combining all sections)

4) Keep history consistent

When user edits skill confidence and score changes:
- save back into the selected history entry in localStorage
- reopening from /history must retain changes

5) Add a calm "Action Next" box

At bottom of /results:
- Show top 3 weak skills (practice-marked)
- Suggest next action:
  "Start Day 1 plan now."

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm live score works
- Confirm toggles persist after refresh
- Verification steps




step 6:prompt 6
Upgrade Placement Readiness Platform by adding a Company Intel + Round Mapping layer.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Keep premium design.
- No external scraping.

1) Company Intel block

On /results, if company name is provided:

Create a structured info card:
- Company name
- Industry (infer simple guess based on keywords or default to "Technology Services")
- Estimated size category:
   - Startup (<200)
   - Mid-size (200–2000)
   - Enterprise (2000+)

Use heuristic rules:
   If company matches known list (Amazon, Infosys, TCS, etc.) → Enterprise
   If unknown → Startup by default

Add:
- "Typical Hiring Focus" section (template text)
   - For Enterprise: structured DSA + core fundamentals
   - For Startup: practical problem solving + stack depth

2) Round Mapping Engine

Based on detected skills and company size:

Generate dynamic round mapping:

Example:
Enterprise + DSA detected →
Round 1: Online Test (DSA + Aptitude)
Round 2: Technical (DSA + Core CS)
Round 3: Tech + Projects
Round 4: HR

Startup + React/Node detected →
Round 1: Practical coding
Round 2: System discussion
Round 3: Culture fit

Display round flow as vertical timeline.

3) Add "Why this round matters" short explanation under each round.

4) Persist this intel inside history entry.

5) Add small note:
"Demo Mode: Company intel generated heuristically."

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm company intel renders correctly.
- Confirm round mapping changes based on company + skills.
- Provide test scenario examples.




step 7:prompt 7
Harden Placement Readiness Platform with strict data model, validation, and edge case handling.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Keep premium design.

1) Input validation on Home (/)
- JD textarea must be required.
- If JD < 200 characters:
  show calm warning:
  "This JD is too short to analyze deeply. Paste full JD for better output."
- Company and Role remain optional.

2) Standardize Analysis Entry Schema
Ensure every saved history entry has these fields (even if empty):
{
  id,
  createdAt,
  company: string | "",
  role: string | "",
  jdText: string,
  extractedSkills: {
    coreCS: string[],
    languages: string[],
    web: string[],
    data: string[],
    cloud: string[],
    testing: string[],
    other: string[]
  },
  roundMapping: [{ roundTitle, focusAreas[], whyItMatters }],
  checklist: [{ roundTitle, items[] }],
  plan7Days: [{ day, focus, tasks[] }],
  questions: string[],
  baseScore: number,
  skillConfidenceMap: { [skill]: "know" | "practice" },
  finalScore: number,
  updatedAt: string
}

3) Default behavior if no skills detected
If extraction returns empty:
- populate "other" with:
  ["Communication", "Problem solving", "Basic coding", "Projects"]
- adjust plan/checklist/questions accordingly.

4) Score stability rules
- baseScore computed only on analyze.
- finalScore changes only based on skillConfidenceMap.
- When user toggles skills:
  update finalScore + updatedAt
  persist to history entry.

5) History robustness
- If localStorage has corrupted entry, skip and show:
  "One saved entry couldn't be loaded. Create a new analysis."

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm schema is consistent.
- Confirm validation works.
- Provide verification steps for edge cases.




step 8:prompt 8
Add a built-in Test Checklist for Placement Readiness Platform and lock shipping until all tests are passed.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT remove features.
- Keep premium design.

1) Add checklist UI on /prp/07-test with these 10 tests:

□ JD required validation works
□ Short JD warning shows for <200 chars
□ Skills extraction groups correctly
□ Round mapping changes based on company + skills
□ Score calculation is deterministic
□ Skill toggles update score live
□ Changes persist after refresh
□ History saves and loads correctly
□ Export buttons copy the correct content
□ No console errors on core pages

Each item must have:
- checkbox
- optional "How to test" hint

2) Add summary at top:
"Tests Passed: X / 10"

Show warning if <10:
"Fix issues before shipping."

3) Ship lock:
Route /prp/08-ship must be locked until all 10 items are checked.

Add reset button:
"Reset checklist"

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm checklist stored in localStorage and persists.
- Confirm /prp/08-ship is locked until checklist complete.
- Verification steps.





step 9:prompt 9

Finalize Placement Readiness Platform with Proof + Submission System.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Keep premium design.
- Do NOT bypass checklist lock.

1) BUILD PROOF PAGE (/prp/proof)

Sections:

A) Step Completion Overview
- Show all 8 steps with status:
  Completed / Pending

B) Artifact Inputs (Required for Ship Status)
- Lovable Project Link (URL validation required)
- GitHub Repository Link (URL validation required)
- Deployed URL (URL validation required)

Store links in localStorage under:
prp_final_submission

2) FINAL SUBMISSION EXPORT

Add button:
"Copy Final Submission"

It should copy formatted text:

------------------------------------------
Placement Readiness Platform — Final Submission

Lovable Project: {link}
GitHub Repository: {link}
Live Deployment: {link}

Core Capabilities:
- JD skill extraction (deterministic)
- Round mapping engine
- 7-day prep plan
- Interactive readiness scoring
- History persistence
------------------------------------------

3) SHIPPED STATUS RULE

Project status badge changes to "Shipped" ONLY IF:
- All 8 steps marked completed
- All 10 checklist items passed
- All 3 proof links provided

Otherwise:
Status remains "In Progress".

4) COMPLETION MESSAGE

When status becomes "Shipped":
Display:

"You built a real product.
Not a tutorial. Not a clone.
A structured tool that solves a real problem.

This is your proof of work."

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm proof page works with URL validation.
- Confirm Shipped status only triggers when all conditions met.
- Confirm copy export produces correct formatted text.
- Verification steps.
